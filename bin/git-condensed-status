# Git prompt support for POSIX shells.
#
# Requirements: git and awk
#
# Reports a condensed version of `git status` for use in a command-line prompt.
#
# For example, the following output:
#
# master...origin/master [ahead 420, behind 69] 1x 1+ 1* 1?
#
# Might correspond to the following **very contrived** (but possible) state in
# a repo, where we have one unmerged changed, one staged change, one unstaged
# change, and one untracked file.
#
# ```
# ~/documents master...origin/master [ahead 420, behind 69] 1x 1+ 1* 1?
# ❯ git status
# On branch master
# Your branch and 'origin/master' have diverged,
# and have 420 and 69 different commits each, respectively.
#   (use "git pull" to merge the remote branch into yours)
#
# You have unmerged paths.
#   (fix conflicts and run "git commit")
#   (use "git merge --abort" to abort the merge)
#
# Changes to be committed:
#
#         new file:   longcat.png
#
# Unmerged paths:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)
#
#         both modified:   the-urban-moms-guide-for-synthesizing-dmt.txt
#
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#         modified:   longcat.png
#
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
