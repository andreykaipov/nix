# Tmux has the option of setting it's copy mode to have Vi-like bindings, but
# let's be honest... it's not really Vim. However, we can harness all the power
# of Vim by copying our pane output into Vim!
#
# This script does exactly that, while juggling our panes so that we can restore
# our current session seemlessly. The way it works is as follows:
#
# 1. Capture the pane output into a Tmux buffer
# 2. Open up a new window piping the contents of that buffer into Vim
# 3. Delete the buffer (who really cares, but why not?)
# 4. Swap the panes
# 5. Set a hook on the current pane to swap with the saved pane when exiting Vim
# 6. Exit Vim
#
# Seemless!

# My nvim's status seems to get a bit funky sometimes when I perform the swap,
# but any idempotent adjustment to the pane will fix it like below. However,
# I think the least jarring glitch is just swapping the pane again twice, as
# it'll only affect the pane instead of propogating to the window!
