# Our macOS settings are stored in plists at ~/.config/macos/*.plist. Sometimes
# we might update our settings via the settings GUI outside of this
# configuration, so to keep our new settings in source control, we have to sync
# them up. That's what this does. This must be manually ran and does not detect
# plists that are not already in source control.

# TODO maybe make this a precommit git hook so it's done every time
