\section{Experience}
\cventryoneline{June 2020 -- Present}{Sr Site Reliability Engineer}{Ultimate Kronos Group}{Weston, FL}{}{
  Cloud Services
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
      Develop and maintain internal Terraform modules abstracting development
      teams' access to public cloud services, integrating with our private cloud
      services API, and helping them seamlessly transition into the public
      cloud.
  \item
      Developed a CLI and workflow system to automate the management of volume
      snapshots and backups for our MySQL and MongoDB services to meet our audit
      deadlines, as they were nonexistent at the time.
  \end{itemize}
  Developer Experience
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
      Worked closely with traditional Windows sysadmins and application owners
      to automate the heavily involved and manual configuration of our core
      products, teaching SRE principles along the way.
  \end{itemize}
}
\cventryoneline{Jan 2020 -- Apr 2020}{Site Reliability Engineer}{Magic Leap}{Plantation, FL}{}{
  Launch Coordination
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
      Wrote Kubernetes operators to manage GCP resources, extending our internal
      PaaS to help our product teams transition from AWS to GCP.
  \item
      Evangelize the technologies of our SRE sister-squads to our product teams,
      while helping them transition to newer company-wide standards.
  \item
      Performed housekeeping across the SRE organization -- upgraded Terraform
      AWS and GCP modules and projects to use the latest versions, upgraded
      Concourse pipelines, transitioned images from ECR and GCR to our private
      Docker registry, and added reusable features to our internal tooling for
      our product teams.
  \end{itemize}
}
\cventryoneline{Jan 2017 -- Jan 2020}{Site Reliability Engineer}{Ultimate Software}{Weston, FL}{}{
  Cloud Platform \& Observability
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
      Developed and managed a centralized logging and metrics collection
      platform for company-wide use to support ingestion of over 5TB/day of logs
      and metrics into our Elasticsearch and InfluxDB clusters across multiple
      datacenters.
  \item
      Managed several VM and container-based orchestration platforms for product
      teams to leverage, including a homegrown PaaS, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, and
      Kubernetes.
  \item
      Partnered with product teams to help developers understand our
      infrastructure and internal tooling, and to help productionalize their
      applications and processes.
  \end{itemize}
