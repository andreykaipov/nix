# git-sweep tidies our local repo's branches.
#
# Typically, I like to delete the remote branch when the respective PR gets
# merged in, so we can't just easily use `git branch --merged` to find which
# branches should be deleted. Instead we do the following:
#
# 1. Remove references to any remote branch that doesn't exist anymore.
# 2. Delete the local branches that were pointing to those references.

git remote prune origin
git branch -v | awk '/\[gone\]/ {print $1}' | xargs git branch -D
